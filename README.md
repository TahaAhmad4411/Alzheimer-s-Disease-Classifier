# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classifier and Timeline of the patient

With the growing age of the population, elderly people are having more issues in forgetting things, even the basic things. This chemical reaction in the brain is irreversible and remains till death. Hence early diagnosis is inevitable. But that also depends upon the several factors, genes, alleles, age, race, marital status and so on. So we need both MRI and tabular data that can be used as captioning in one model only. 
Our goal is to predict the timeline of the patient so as to have a proper treatment( and rigorous, if required) of the patient.
The model we are using is Video Vision Transformers that converts the images into videos.
